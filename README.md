# Assignment 2: Arrays and Loops

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice working with arrays and loops in Go. It introduces basic 
data structures, iteration, and conditional logic to manipulate and display values within an array.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `arrays_assignment.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that:
   - Declares an array of integers with 5 elements.
   - Uses a loop to populate the array with values.
   - Uses a second loop to print each element, its square, and whether the element is odd or even.
3. Update the README with instructions on how to compile and run this program.

**Example Output:**

```
Element 1: 1, Square: 1, Odd
Element 2: 2, Square: 4, Even
Element 3: 3, Square: 9, Odd
Element 4: 4, Square: 16, Even
Element 5: 5, Square: 25, Odd
```

Via le chemin relatif jâ€™execute ce qui suit : go run arrays_and_loops.go (compilation + execution) go 
build 
arrays_and_loops.go (compilation) pour exec : ./arrays_and_loops.go (execution)
