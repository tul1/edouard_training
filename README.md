# Assignment 4: Structs, Public and Private Methods

## Objective

This assignment introduces structs and how to create public and private methods in Go.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `structs_assignment.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that:
   - Defines a `Person` struct with fields `firstName` (string), `lastName` (string), and `age` (int).
   - Creates a private method `isAdult()` that checks if a person is 18 years or older.
   - Creates a public method `PrintInfo()` that prints the person’s full name and whether they are an 
adult (using the `isAdult()` method).
3. Update the README with instructions on how to run this program.

**Example Output:**

```
Full Name: John Doe, Age: 20
John is an adult.
```

Via le chemin relatif j’execute ce qui suit : go run structs_public_and_private_methods.go (compilation 
+ execution) go build 
structs_public_and_private_methods.go (compilation) pour exec : ./structs_public_and_private_methods.go 
(execution)
