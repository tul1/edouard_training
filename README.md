# Golang Training Repository

This repository is dedicated to Edouard's Golang training assignments. Each assignment will contain specific instructions and code related to Edouard's learning journey in Go.

## Topics Covered by the Training

1. **Hello World and Setup**: Basic Go environment setup and printing to stdout.
2. **Arrays and Loops**: Working with arrays, loops, and conditionals (odd/even checks).
3. **String Manipulation**: Reading user input, transforming strings, and reversing them.
4. **Structs, Public and Private Methods**: Defining structs, creating public and private methods, and interacting with struct fields.
5. **Pointers and Pointer Semantics**: Understanding pointers, value vs. pointer semantics, and passing structs by pointer.
6. **Data Structures (Maps)**: Working with hash maps (`map` in Go), adding, updating, and deleting elements.
7. **Logic Operators (Switch, Loops)**: Using `switch` statements, `for` loops (including `while` and `do-while` equivalents), and conditionals.
8. **Context and Goroutines**: Introduction to `context` in Go and controlling goroutines with timeout and cancellation.
9. **Concurrent File Writing with Goroutines**: Implementing concurrency with goroutines to write to a file and using synchronization.
10. **Fan-In and Fan-Out with Goroutines**: Learning the fan-in and fan-out concurrency patterns, merging results from multiple goroutines.
11. **Generics in Go with Generic Field Types**: Showcasing how generics can make data structures more flexible.
12. **Linked Lists**: Learning the concept of a **linked list** and demonstrates how to create and manage nodes within it.
13. **Stacks and Queues Combined**: Working with **stacks** and **queues** and demonstrates how to use them together by implementing a program that processes data in both **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** and **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** order.
14. **Binary Trees**: Introduction to the **binary tree** data structure, which is fundamental in sorting, searching, and hierarchical data storage.
15. **Maze Solver with BFS and DFS**: Learning to implement **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms to find a path through a maze.
16. **Unit Testing with Mocking**: Introduction to unit testing in Go using the **testing** package, the **testify** library, and **mockgen** for generating mocks.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to this repository and solve the exercises in the folders, you must create a pull request. All pull requests will be reviewed and must be validated before being merged into the main branch.

   cd golang-training-repo
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your exercise solution:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Work on your solution** and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add solution for [exercise-name]"
   ```

4. **Push the branch** to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-branch-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request** on GitHub:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - You will see a banner to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch. Click "Compare & pull request."
   - Add a descriptive title and comments explaining your changes.
   - Submit the pull request.

Once your pull request is created, it will be reviewed. If everything is correct, it will be merged into the main branch. If changes are needed, feedback will be provided for adjustments.
