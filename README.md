# Golang Training Repository

This repository is dedicated to Edouard's Golang training assignments. Each assignment will contain specific instructions and code related to Edouard's learning journey in Go.

## Assignment 1: Hello World

### Objective

For this first assignment, Edouard needs to write a simple Go program (`hello_world.go`) that prints the message `hello world!` to stdout. This exercise is to ensure that Edouard sets up his Go environment correctly and pushes his first piece of code to the repository.

### Instructions

1. Create a file named `hello_world.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that prints `hello world!` to stdout.
3. Update this README with instructions on how to run the `hello_world.go` code. The instructions should explain how to compile and run the program using Go.
