# Assignment 3: String Manipulation

## Objective

This assignment introduces working with strings and string functions in Go, focusing on manipulating 
and transforming strings.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `strings_assignment.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that:
   - Reads a string from the user input (e.g., "Hello, Gophers!").
   - Converts the string to uppercase and prints the result.
   - Reverses the string and prints the reversed version.
3. Update the README with instructions on how to run this program.

**Example Output:**

```
Original String: Hello, Gophers!
Uppercase String: HELLO, GOPHERS!
Reversed String: !srehpoG ,olleH
```

Via le chemin relatif jâ€™execute ce qui suit : go run strings_and_functions.go (compilation + execution) 
go build 
strings_and_functions.go (compilation) pour exec : ./strings_and_functions.go (execution)
