# Assignment 2: Arrays and Loops

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice working with arrays and loops in Go. It introduces basic data structures, iteration, and conditional logic to manipulate and display values within an array.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `arrays_assignment.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that:
   - Declares an array of integers with 5 elements.
   - Uses a loop to populate the array with values.
   - Uses a second loop to print each element, its square, and whether the element is odd or even.
3. Update the README with instructions on how to compile and run this program.

**Example Output:**

```
Element 1: 1, Square: 1, Odd
Element 2: 2, Square: 4, Even
Element 3: 3, Square: 9, Odd
Element 4: 4, Square: 16, Even
Element 5: 5, Square: 25, Odd
```

# Array Squaring and Even/Odd Identifier
   
create basic array and loop over it to print simple values
   
## How it works
1- Initialize an array of 5integer and odd var of type string
2- Iterate over array with value i
3- at each iteration, associate index of array with i*i
4- at each iteration check if modulo 2 of array index is 0 or not, if 0 then associate odd string value to odd var else associate even value to odd var
5- at each iteration print index of element, value of element, square of element and if element is odd or not)
