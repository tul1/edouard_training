# Assignment 7: Switch and Loops

## Objective

This assignment will help you understand control flow using logic operators in Go, focusing on `switch`, `while`, and `do while` equivalents (`for` loop in Go).

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `logic_operators.go`.
2. Inside the file, write a Go program that:
   - Reads an integer from user input.
   - Uses a `switch` statement to print a message depending on the value of the number (e.g., "positive", "negative", or "zero").
   - Uses a `for` loop (simulating a `while`) to count down from the entered number to zero and print each value.
   - Uses a `for` loop (simulating a `do-while`) that keeps asking the user to input a number until they enter a positive integer.
3. Update the README with instructions on how to compile and run this program.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter a number: 3
The number is positive.
Counting down: 3, 2, 1, 0
Enter a number: -1
Please enter a positive number: -5
Please enter a positive number: 2
You entered a positive number: 2
```
